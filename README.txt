We created a Wordle solver that solves the viral Wordle game, recently bought out by New York Times. The website that we sourced our game from is:

There are two ways to use this program, you can either use your own user input or using an online scraper involving Selenium. To use the user input way, you must input a string of "green(g) yellow(y) or neither(n)" in accordance to the response you got from the word guessed on wordle. Then it provides you with the following next best word to try. Using the Selenium method, it will open up a new Chrome window, doing all the guesses for you and (hopefully) solving the puzzle.
